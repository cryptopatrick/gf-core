Created examples/ folder with three Rust examples:

  1. basic_usage.rs - Shows how to load a GF grammar from JSON, parse trees, and linearize in multiple languages
  2. parsing_and_completion.rs - Demonstrates advanced parsing with multiple trees, tagged linearization, and completion
   suggestions
  3. translation_service.rs - Interactive translation service showing real-world usage with multilingual translation and
   completion hints

  All examples use the existing test grammar (Hello.json) and showcase the core GF functionality: parsing, linearization,
   translation, and completion.
